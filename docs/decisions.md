# Decisions

A shared log of decisions that affect more than one area. Every session adds an entry here when it decides something
others must know: a shared file it needs changed, an API another area uses, a design token, a price or a quota, a new
table or route. Newest first. The master reads this before each merge.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD – short title (area)
What was decided, why, and what other areas must do. Status: proposed | accepted | done.
```

## 2026-11-12 – The dev server's port lives in wrangler.toml (master)

Answer to design's entry "`npm run dev -- --port N` fails in the area worktrees": `package.json` now runs plain
`wrangler dev`, and `wrangler.toml` has `[dev] port = 8788`. `npm run dev -- --port 8789 --inspector-port 9230` works
in a worktree (tested next to the running 8788). Areas: merge `main` into your branch to get it; ai-features moves back
from 8791 to its own 8790. Status: done.

## 2026-11-12 – The project is worked on in parallel (master)

Four sessions, each in its own worktree and branch: master (`main`, `M:\Claude Code\Helper`), design (`design`,
`Helper-design`), business (`business`, `Helper-business`), ai-features (`ai-features`, `Helper-ai`). Ownership of
files, ports and the merge rules are in `CLAUDE.md` under "Working in parallel". Areas may append routes, tables and
columns for their own features and log them here; `public/sw.js` `CACHE` is bumped only by the master on merge.
The feasibility study moved to `docs/business/standalone-feasibility.md`. Status: done.
